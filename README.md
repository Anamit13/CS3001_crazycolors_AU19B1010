# DAY01:  
# Introduction:
This game includes entertainment and education both. Basically it is for children less than 12 years. This game is designed by seeing that today’s child generation have less knowledge of colors and there respond time is also less. So, to increase the knowledge in color and increase in respond time this game is designed. It’s a very simple game.

# Description:
This is a very simple game and anyone can play and understand it. In this game there will be a canvas and on that a color name will be written with a different text color and the user has to enter that color in the text box given below. There will be a time limit starting from 15 sec and as the game goes ahead the time will decrease by 1sec. And it contains two categories of easy and hard. In hard the time limit will decrease by 2sec.

# Rules and guidelines to play:
These rules and regulations will be given in the game also:
1.	Firstly, you have to choose easy or hard level you want to play.
2.	Then, you have to see the text which come on the screen randomly and identify that text color. Actually the text will also be a color only.
3.	Put your answer in the text box within the running time.
4.	If the answer will be right than another random color will come on the screen.
5.	If the answer is wrong then you will get one more chance for the same and if again it goes wrong the game will automatically get over.
6.	The score will get updated as you go ahead in the game by +1.
7.	You can also quit the game at the same time.


# DAY02:
 •	How to make the game interactive with user.
 
 
# Technical requirements:
So, this a python game so of course it will require some technical requirements for the algorithm and for source code.
	First of all I thought of the using tkinter for GUI purpose. So, to use tkinter we’ve to import tkinter. 
	TO show the color text on the screen we’ve to include message box from tkinter.
	To set the time limit for user input we have to import time module which can represent the time in code.
	We’ve to include random module also to generate random color on the screen after each user input.

Decomposition:
•	How to generate random color on the screen.
•	How to use the time module to deal with the time limit.
•	How to make the game interactive with user.
•	How to take user input on the screen.
•	How to check whether the user input is correct or not.
•	How to end the game.
